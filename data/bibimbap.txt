Bibimbap[1] (/ˈbiːbɪmbæp/ BEE-bim-bap;[2] Korean: 비빔밥; lit. mixed rice; Korean pronunciation: [pi.bim.p͈ap̚]), sometimes romanized as bi bim bap or bi bim bop, is a Korean rice dish.

The term bibim means "mixing" and bap is cooked rice. It is served as a bowl of warm white rice topped with namul (sautéed or blanched seasoned vegetables) and gochujang (chili pepper paste). Egg and sliced meat (usually beef) are common additions, stirred together thoroughly just before eating.[3]

In South Korea, Jeonju, Jinju, and Tongyeong are especially famous for their versions of bibimbap.[4] In 2017, the dish was listed at number 40 on the World's 50 most delicious foods readers' poll compiled by CNN Travel.[5]
