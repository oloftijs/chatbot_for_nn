Pierogi[a][b] are filled dumplings, made by wrapping unleavened dough around a filling, and occasionally flavored with a savory or sweet garnish and cooking in boiling water.

Pierogi or their varieties are associated with the cuisines of Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe. Dumplings most likely originated in Asia and came to Europe via trade in the Middle Ages.[1][2] The widely used English name pierogi was derived from Polish. In East Europe and parts of Canada they are known as varenyky,[3] or, in some dialects, pyrohy.[4] Pierogi are also popular in modern-day American cuisine where they are sometimes known under different local names.

Typical fillings include potato, cheese, quark, sauerkraut, ground meat, edible mushrooms, fruits, and/or berries. Savory pierogi are often served with a topping of sour cream, fried onions, or both
