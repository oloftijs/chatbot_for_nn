Gnocchi (/ˈn(j)ɒki/ N(Y)OK-ee,[1] US also /ˈn(j)oʊki, ˈn(j)ɔːki/ N(Y)OH-kee, N(Y)AW-,[2][3][4][5] Italian: [ˈɲɔkki]; singular gnocco) are a varied family of Pasta in Italian cuisine.[6] They are made of small lumps of dough most traditionally composed of a simple combination of wheat flour,[7] egg,[8] salt, and potato.[9] Variations of the dish supplement the simple recipe with flavour additives, such as semolina flour,[10] cheese,[11] breadcrumbs,[12] cornmeal[13] or similar ingredients,[14][15][16] and possibly including herbs, vegetables, and other ingredients. Base ingredients may be substituted with alternatives such as sweet potatoes for potatoes or rice flour for wheat flour. Such variations are often considered to be non-traditional.[13]

Gnocchi are commonly cooked in salted boiling water and then dressed with various sauces.[13] They are usually eaten as a first course (primo piatto) as an alternative to soups (minestre) or pasta, but they can also be served as a contorno (side dish) to some main courses.[13] Common accompaniments of gnocchi include melted butter with sage, pesto, as well as various sauces. Gnocchi may be homemade, made by specialty stores, or produced industrially and distributed refrigerated, dried, or frozen. Most gnocchi are boiled in water and then served with a sauce. Small soup gnocchi are sometimes made by pressing the dough through a coarse sieve or a perforated spoon.
