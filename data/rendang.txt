Rendang (/ˈrəndɑːŋ/ RəN-dahng; Indonesian pronunciation: [rənˈdaŋ]) is a Minangkabau dish. It is a rich dish of meat that has been slow cooked and braised in a coconut milk seasoned with a herb and spice mixture over a period of several hours until the liquids evaporate and the meat turns dark brown and tender, becoming caramelized and infused with rich flavours.[5][6]

It originated from the Minangkabau region in West Sumatra, Indonesia.[7] It has spread across Indonesian cuisine to the cuisines of neighbouring Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and the Philippines.[2] As the signature dish of Minangkabau culture, rendang is traditionally served at ceremonial occasions to honour guests during festive events; such as wedding feasts and Lebaran (Indonesian popular words for both Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha).[8] Rendang is also traditionally served among the Malay community in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, as well as the Maranao in the Philippines.[9]

Rendang is officially recognised as one of Indonesia's national dishes. Six types of rendang preparations have also been designated as intangible cultural heritage by the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture. A broad survey in 2011 placed beef rendang as the most delicious dish in the world
