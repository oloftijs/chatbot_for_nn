Risotto (/rɪˈzɒtoʊ/ riz-OT-oh, Italian: [riˈzɔtto, -ˈsɔt-]; from riso meaning "rice")[1] is an Italian rice dish cooked with broth until it reaches a creamy consistency. The broth can be derived from meat, fish, or vegetables. Many types of risotto contain butter, onion, white wine, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. It is one of the most common ways of cooking rice in Italy. Saffron was originally used for flavour and its signature yellow colour.[2][3]

Risotto in Italy is often a first course served before a second course, but risotto alla milanese is often served with ossobuco alla milanese as a one-course meal.[4]
