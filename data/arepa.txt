Arepa (Spanish pronunciation: [aˈɾepa]) is a type of food made of ground maize dough stuffed with a filling, eaten in northern parts of South America since pre-Columbian times, and notable primarily in the cuisine of Venezuela and Colombia, but also present in Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Panama.[1][2]

Initially, arepa flour was made by grinding maize at home. In the 1950s, precooked arepa flour was invented by Luis Caballero Mejías, a Venezuelan engineer, and became an instant success.

Arepa is commonly eaten in those countries and can be served with accompaniments such as cheese,[3] cuajada (fresh cheese), various types of meat, avocado, or diablito (deviled ham spread). It can also be split to make sandwiches. Sizes, maize types, and added ingredients vary based on preparation. It is similar to the Mexican gordita, the Salvadoran pupusa, the Ecuadorian tortilla de maíz,[4] and the Panamanian tortilla or changa.[5]
