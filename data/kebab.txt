Kebab (UK: /kɪˈbæb/, US: /kɪˈbɑːb/; Persian: كباب,[1] kabāb, Arabic: كباب,[2] [kaˈbaːb]; Turkish: kebap, [cebɑp]), kabob (North American), or kebap or kabab is roasted meat that originates from the Middle East but has been popularised by Iranian cuisine & Turkish cuisine. Many variants of the category are popular around the world, including the skewered shish kebab and the doner kebab with bread.

Kebabs consist of cut up or ground meat, sometimes with vegetables and various other accompaniments according to the specific recipe. Although kebabs are typically cooked on a skewer over a fire, some kebab dishes are oven-baked in a pan, or prepared as a stew such as tas kebab.[3][4] The traditional meat for kebabs is most often lamb meat, but regional recipes may include beef, goat, chicken, fish, or even pork (depending on whether or not there are specific religious prohibitions).
