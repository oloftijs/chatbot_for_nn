Pho[a] (UK: /fɜː/, US: /fə/, Canada: /fɔː/; Vietnamese: [fəː˧˩˧] ⓘ) is a Vietnamese soup dish consisting of broth, rice noodles (bánh phở), herbs, and meat (usually beef (phở bò), sometimes chicken (phở gà)).[3][4] Phở is a popular food in Vietnam[5] where it is served in households, street-stalls, and restaurants country-wide. Residents of the city of Nam Định were the first to create Vietnamese traditional phở. It is considered Vietnam's national dish.[6]

Phở originated in the early 20th century in Northern Vietnam, and was popularized throughout the world by refugees after the Vietnam War. Because phở's origins are poorly documented,[7][8] there is disagreement over the cultural influences that led to its development in Vietnam, as well as the etymology of the name.[9] The Hanoi (northern) and Saigon (southern) styles of pho differ by noodle width, sweetness of broth, and choice of herbs and sauce.
